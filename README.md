# Biofilm_Analysis
Tools to study biofilms using Z-Stack from a confocal microscope

Macro_Extract-Data_Biofilm-Image.ijm is a file that contains a macro that is useful to analyse multiple microscopy images. It assumes that the images were acquired with a Zeiss microscope (so the images are saved in Zeiss' .czi extension). The macro is executable on FIJI software.

The Analyse_Biofilm.py file is made to analyse the data that is extracted by the macro right before.
